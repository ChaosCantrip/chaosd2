## About
**chaosd2** is a website designed to make it easier to find and share guides for various activities in Destiny 2.
<br/>
After Root of Nightmares released, I found myself constantly having to look up the map for the Planets encounter to share with people running it for the first time. Sure, that's not an arduous task, but I figured surely there must be a better way. 
<br/>
So I created it!
<br/><br/>
The website is built around its' redirects system, so you don't have to remember any specific way to share links. Players can use the shortcodes or nicknames of encounters and the website will redirect them to the revelvant content!
<br/>
For example, if you wanted to share the map for the Planets encounter, the actual URL would be `https://chaosd2.com/raids/root_of_nightmares/3`.
<br/>
However, that's kind of obnoxious to type and remember. However, Root of Nightmares is also known as Root, so why not just use `https://chaosd2.com/raids/root/3`.
Then again, there's no dungeon called Root, so we can shorten it again to `https://chaosd2.com/root/3`. The whole website is built around this system. Even encounter numbers can be replaced. Who needs to remember that Daughters is the 4th encounter of King's Fall when they can just put `https://chaosd2.com/kf/daughters`.
<br/><br/>
The website also includes metadata built for Discord, meaning that rather than just showing up as an image or link, sending the link in Discord will cause it to show up as an embed including the image itself and details of the encounter.
<br/><br/>
**chaosd2** is built in `next.js` by @ChaosCantrip, and hosted on `Vercel`.
